# Java-Vehicle-Project
This project demonstrates Java OOP concepts, focusing on interfaces. It includes classes implementing a Vehicle interface with methods like accelerate and getSpeed. The project showcases both a working version and an error version, where a class omits a required method, resulting in a compile-time error.
